# EDA_Optimising_NYC_Taxis
In this case study, we will learn exploratory data analysis (EDA) using a dataset on yellow taxi rides in New York City. This will enable you to understand why EDA is an important step in data science and machine learning.

# Problem Statement
As an analyst at an upcoming taxi operation in NYC, I am tasked with using the 2023 taxi trip data to uncover insights that could help optimise taxi operations. The goal is to analyse patterns in the data that can inform strategic decisions to improve service efficiency, maximise revenue, and enhance passenger experience.
